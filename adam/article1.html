                        <h1>Technology takes over in Seoul</h1>

                            <p class="p">Passengers arriving at Seoul's Incheon airport (number two on this year's best airports list) for the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games in February were among the first to try out the airport's state-of-the-art new Terminal 2, opened only weeks before.
                                As well as adding much-needed capacity to the country's main international gateway, developers designed the building around passenger needs by focusing on technology.
                                The centerpiece of the terminal is the Great Hall, which covers four stories. Decorated heavily in granite and wood, it features artworks by local artists.
                                But the fun starts when you notice the fleet of robots on hand to help passengers navigate the airport.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p">
                                Forget finding an information desk or complicated terminal map.
                                These friendly helpers will scan your boarding pass and escort you to your gate, conversing with you in any of four languages -- Korean, English, Mandarin and Japanese.
                                When not directly interacting with passengers, the robots helpfully wander around flashing final boarding calls.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p" id="p">
                                Robots at Incheon are not only there to help guide passengers, however. There's also a model tasked with making sure the new terminal is kept clean and tidy, remembering where the dirtiest places are and efficiently working its way around like a giant Roomba.
                                "I was also impressed to find live music, centers where people could learn about and try out traditional arts. and fun play areas for both kids and adults," says Baskas.</p>
